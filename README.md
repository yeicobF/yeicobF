### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Jacob and I'm passionate about web development and technology. I'm currently working at Qualtrics as a Software Support Engineer.

Back in 2018, I started on my academic journey in Intelligent Systems Engineering at UASLP. I found my passion when I stumbled upon web technologies and what frontend development was.

I love being part of a community, sharing my knowledge, and learning from others. I have participated in multiple hackathons and given talks to my university peers.
